# KitApp

The **KitApp** is an essential context for the proper functioning of the **design system** components.

## Important

If you don't use KitApp, you'll get **missing styles** and **errors** when using components.

## Purpose of the KitApp

The kitApp is mainly used to supply the various components with **style** overloads. For the moment, the KitApp provide a default **Aristid Theme**. In the futur, it will be possible to customize every component with theme tokens.

## How to use KitApp

You just have to encapsulate your application with the KitApp Component.

```tsx 
<KitApp>
    <App />
</KitApp>
```

## About the Design system fonts

The design system relies on 'Inter font'. By default, the KitApp component includes the font. There are 3 main cases you may not want to include the font :
- You have arleady included it
- You have a custom theme wich do not use this font
- you have more than one KitApp in your app

You can avoid KitApp to include the font by specifying the `includeFont` property to false

```tsx
<KitApp includeFont={false}>
    <App />
</KitApp>
```

##### NB : For performance concerns, if you use more than one KitApp, only one may include the font

## Error

If you get the following error : `You need to encapsulate component inside a KitApp, useKitTheme must be inside a context`, you probably missing to add the KitApp.
