# Translation

The design system supports `French` and `English` translation. You can override translation by passing the props `locale` to KitApp.

### Override

A token system is available to override. As the design system is build on top of `antd`, the major part of tokens are override by antd [cf Antd translation documentation](https://ant.design/docs/react/i18n) and an other part of tokens are design system token. They folllow the same logic as antd.

### Where you can find tokens ?

Translation tokens are documentated in the section `Translation Tokens` of every components.

### useKitLocale

You can access all tokens inside KitApp with the hook `useKitLocale`.

```tsx
import {useKitLocale} from 'aristid-ds';

const {locale} = useKitLocale();
```

The locale object contains information about the current translation.
