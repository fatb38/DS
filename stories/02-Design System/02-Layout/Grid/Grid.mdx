# Grid

Variable grid system for layout.

## Design concept

In most business situations, Aristid DS needs to solve a lot of information storage problems within the design area. We divided area in variable column numbers based on the screen size.


## Outline

In the grid system, we define the frame outside the information area based on  `grid`, `row` and `column`, to ensure that every area can have stable arrangement.

Following is a brief look at how it works:

- Establish a set of `column` in the horizontal space defined by `row` (abbreviated col).
- Your content elements should be placed directly in the `col`, and only `col` should be placed directly in `row`.
- The column grid system is a value of 4-12 to represent its range spans.

Our grid systems base on Grid layout to allow the elements within the parent to be aligned horizontally. The Grid system also supports vertical alignment.

The grid system manages a SideMenu open state. When menu is open, columns are pushed to the right and resized if necessary.

## Examples

### Basic Grid

From the stack to the horizontal arrangement.

You can create a basic grid system by using a single set of `Row` and `Col` grid assembly, all of the columns `Col` must be placed in `Row`.


<CustomCanvas content={Examples.Basic} source={Sources.Basic} id="grid-basic"/>

### Grid
The `Grid` component is an optional wrapper for Row Elements. It allows to display a `SideMenu`and handles its open/close state automatically and passes it to Its `Row` children.
If `SideMenuProps`is not defined, the `Grid` component will only render Rows.

***Note:*** you can set its `menuOpen` prop to `true` to open the `SideMenu` if set or to symply pass it to its `Row` elements.

<CustomCanvas content={Examples.Grid} source={Sources.Grid} id="grid-grid" />

###### Grid with SideMenu

<CustomCanvas content={Examples.GridMenu} source={Sources.GridMenu} id="grid-grid-menu" />

### Row
`Row`is the main component of the Grid system. It defines the number and size of columns. By default, the number of columns is set automatically according to the window size.
You can however set its `breakpoint` property to specify  which breakpoint to use to set the number of columns. Like `Grid` component, it accepts a `menuOpen` property.


<CustomCanvas content={Examples.Row} source={Sources.Row} id="grid-row" />

### Col

Every `Row` element should contain only `Col` elements, and `Col`element should only be used inside a `Row` element. `Col` element wraps content to be displayed in a column.
It can be aligned veretically with `alignself` property.

* You can use it as a flex container by setting its `flex` property to `true` and use its `align` and `justify` properties to align its children.
* You can also set its position and span by setting `col` and `span` properties.
* You can set `fullWidth` to `true` to make the column span the full width of the row.

**Note:** if you set `span` to -1, the column will span the remaining space.
