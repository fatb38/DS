# Grid

24 Grids System.

## Design concept

In most business situations, Ant Design needs to solve a lot of information storage problems within the design area, so based on 12 Grids System, we divided the design area into 24 sections.

We name the divided area 'box'. We suggest four boxes for horizontal arrangement at most, one at least. Boxes are proportional to the entire screen as shown in the picture above. To ensure a high level of visual comfort, we customize the typography inside of the box based on the box unit.

## Outline

In the grid system, we define the frame outside the information area based on `row` and `column`, to ensure that every area can have stable arrangement.

Following is a brief look at how it works:

- Establish a set of `column` in the horizontal space defined by `row` (abbreviated col).
- Your content elements should be placed directly in the `col`, and only `col` should be placed directly in `row`.
- The column grid system is a value of 1-24 to represent its range spans. For example, three columns of equal width can be created by `<KitGrid.Col span={8} />`.
- If the sum of `col` spans in a `row` are more than 24, then the overflowing `col` as a whole will start a new line arrangement.

Our grid systems base on Flex layout to allow the elements within the parent to be aligned horizontally - left, center, right, wide arrangement, and decentralized arrangement. The Grid system also supports vertical alignment - top aligned, vertically centered, bottom-aligned. You can also define the order of elements by using `order`.

Layout uses a 24 grid layout to define the width of each "box", but does not rigidly adhere to the grid layout.

## Examples

##### Basic Grid

From the stack to the horizontal arrangement.

You can create a basic grid system by using a single set of `Row` and `Col` grid assembly, all of the columns (Col) must be placed in `Row`.

##### Column offset

`offset` can set the column to the right side. For example, using `offset = {4}` can set the element shifted to the right four columns width.

##### Grid sort

By using `push` and `pull` class you can easily change column order.


<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.GridSort} source={Sources.GridSort} id="grid-sort"/>

##### Typesetting

Child elements depending on the value of the `start`, `center`, `end`, which are defined in its parent node typesetting mode.


<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.Typesetting} source={Sources.Typesetting} id="grid-typesetting"/>

##### Alignment

Child elements vertically aligned.


<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.Alignment} source={Sources.Alignment} id="grid-alignment"/>

##### Order

To change the element sort by `order`.


<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.Order} source={Sources.Order} id="grid-order"/>

##### Flex stretch

Col provides `flex` prop to support fill rest.


<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.Stretch} source={Sources.Stretch} id="grid-stretch"/>

##### Responsive

Referring to the Bootstrap responsive design, here preset six dimensions: `xs` `sm` `md` `lg` `xl` `xxl`.


<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.Responsive} source={Sources.Responsive} id="grid-responsive"/>

##### More responsive

`span` `pull` `push` `offset` `order` property can be embedded into `xs` `sm` `md` `lg` `xl` `xxl` properties to use, where `xs={6}` is equivalent to `xs={{span: 6}}`.
