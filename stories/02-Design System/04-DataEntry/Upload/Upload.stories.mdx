##### Pictures Wall

After users upload picture, the thumbnail will be shown in list. The upload button will disappear when count meets limitation.

<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.PicturesWall} source={Sources.PicturesWall} />

##### Default Files

Use `defaultFileList` for uploaded files when page init.

<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.DefaultFiles} source={Sources.DefaultFiles} />

##### Pictures with list style

If uploaded file is a picture, the thumbnail can be shown. `IE8/9` do not support local thumbnail show. Please use `thumbUrl` instead.

<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.ListStyle} source={Sources.ListStyle} />

##### Drag and Drop

You can drag files to a specific area, to upload. Alternatively, you can also upload by selecting.

We can upload serveral files at once in modern browsers by giving the input the `multiple` attribute.

<CustomCanvas content={Exemples.DragNDrop} source={Sources.DragNDrop} />
